## Viennoiseries

Inspired by French tradition, but made in Washington's Columbia Heights neighborhood, our bakery focuses on making delectable pastries for a happy morning or an afternoon pick-me-up.

## The Best Croissants in DC

We're confident that after you've tried our freshly made croissants (we think they're the best in DC), you'll go nowhere else.

Our all-butter croissants come also come in Almond, Hazelnut, and Pistachio flavors as well as Pain au Chocolat. We make them fresh, each morning.

We carry a rotating selection of scones, cinnamon rolls, raisin escargots and other delicious pastries.

We can happily provide these items for catering orders - just email us at contact@lecapricedc.com or call 202-290-3109.
