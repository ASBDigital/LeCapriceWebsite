##### Le Caprice is a bakery and caf√© located in the heart of Columbia Heights. We're a family-run small business, specializing in delicious croissants, pastries, cakes and breakfast dishes.

# Our Story

Our roots begin in Thionville, France, where one of our owners fell in love with classic French patisserie - and ended up running a bakery. When our family moved to the United States, we wanted to bring fresh baked pastries, cakes, and breads to Washington. 

We take special pride in our butter croissants, made fresh daily. We carry many varieties of cookies and cakes, serve freshly made coffee and espresso drinks, and stock all the essentials for your small, neighborhood cafe.
